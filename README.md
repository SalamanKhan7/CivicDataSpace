  - Title, description, publisher, and sector tags
  - Date formatting, download count, and source website link
  - Conditional rendering of charts icon and publisher logos
- Mobile-friendly navigation with **hamburger toggle menu**
- Integrated **environment variables** for API base URL
- Wrote **unit test cases** using **React Testing Library**
- Structured project folders with **scalability and maintainability** in mind
